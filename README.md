# Math Games (Python)
Simple math mini games written in Python.  

This is a collection of small mini-games which are themselves written as an exercise to practice Python. Well, and maybe math as well =)

## Games
### Add Numbers
User is given 2 random numbers and asked to add them. Then the game checks if the answer is correct, and tells how much time they've spent thinking on the answer. Supports recursive invocation, by passing `-r` or `--repeat` option.  

### Guessing Game
Random number is generated at the beginning of the game, and user has to keep guessing it until it's exactly the right number. When they're wrong, the hint tells them if the guess was higher or lower then the expected number. When they're right, the game will show how many tries the user spent to guess the right number, and how much time it took.
