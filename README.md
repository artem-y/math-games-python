# Python Math Games
Simple math games in python.  

This is a collection of small mini-games which are themselves written as an exercise to practice Python. Well, and maybe math as well =)

## Games
### Add Numbers
User is given 2 random numbers and asked to add them. Then the game checks if the answer is correct, and tells how long they've spent thinking on the answer. Supports recursive invocation, by passwing `-r` or `--repeat` option.
